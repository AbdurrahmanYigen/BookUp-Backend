## Testing


This project uses automated tests to make sure that the API runs correctly. You can find those test in `/test`.
Furthermore, you can import the Postman-Collection provieded in `/Postman` to your Postman client and execute the given tests to convince yourself that the routes are working.  


When working with Postman, make sure to adjust the request so you are refencing existing ids, when working with foreign keys, otherwise you will run in 500 Errors. 

You will also need to adjust the Postman requests for routes that need an authorization. You can distinguish between routes that need an authorization and routes that don't need an authorization by looking into the `Headers` field of the Postman request. 
If the `Headers` field looks like this:

![Postman Request with Authorization Header](images/With_Authorization.png)

then you will need to put the JWT into the value field (marked with a red arrow in the picture above).

To get the JWT, you need to run `Register User` request first. Then log in via `Login User by Email and Password` request. If you logged yourself in correctly, you will recieve the JWT as shown in the following picture.     

![Login returns JWT](images/Login_returns_JWT_LI.jpg)
